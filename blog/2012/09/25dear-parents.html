		Dear Parents,<br />This is my new blog. I want to share all of my exploits at college with you. &nbsp;I know classes started a few weeks ago, but I'll just give you a recap: school. That's what happened last week and the week before and the week before that, but not the week before that.<br /><br />Today, I had a chemistry test. &nbsp;Not just any test or quiz. No, a <i>chemistry</i> test. &nbsp;I have never even taken high school chemistry so most of this is pretty new. &nbsp;I studied all day yesterday and more today. &nbsp;I got there and the test was 20 multiple choice questions and two short answer.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />All of that studying for nothing. &nbsp;Well, not really nothing. I did use the polyatomic ions that I memorized this morning, but everything else was super easy. &nbsp;I had worried for nothing, but now I am chemistry free. Until tomorrow anyways. Oh well...<br /><br />Topic change<br /><br />I also had chem lab today along with the test. We titrated vinegear with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). &nbsp;I did a perfect titration my very first try, but then I had to do it four more times to get three volumes that were within .5mL of each other. I still got out of lab an hour early, and I got to make pretty pink solutions. Remember, if it's pink it can go down the sink (pink means the&nbsp;phenolphthalein, the indicator, has indicated that the pH is between 8 and 9, so the solution has been neutralized).<br /><br />I also worked today, and did research on twins. &nbsp;I myself am a twin, so I am doing my next English paper on the misconceptions surrounding twins. &nbsp;For example, if you punch Brittan (my twin sister) I can't feel it, but it is really really funny (so keep punching her). &nbsp;Finally, I have been obsessed with the Big Bang Theory theme song all week. &nbsp;It is so much fun, and I know all of the words.<br /><br />Well that's all for now.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
