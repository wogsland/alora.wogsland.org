Dear Parents,<br />Today was very hectic. I had five classes today and I kept losing track of time while playing on Minecraft. I am doomed. Madi (my roommate) helped me get Minecraft, and now I am addicted. &nbsp;I played for two hours this morning, and I did tons of new stuff. &nbsp;I killed a cow, found coal, found iron, made torches, finished my tree house with a ginormo sunset window, and I made a furnace. &nbsp;Playing on peaceful mode is nice: monsters don't come get me and I don't have to eat. Ooh, and I made a door for my house. &nbsp;I'm so excited, and I don't have much homework right now. &nbsp;Well, except for my English paper that's due next Friday which I should probably be working on right now. &nbsp;Oops. Oh well, time for a break down of my day.<br /><br />First I went to Chemistry and we learned how to calculate moles and number of molecules and molarity. It was kind of confusing, but I think I get it now. &nbsp;I definitely should know it because that's what I have to do on my lab.<br /><br />College Algebra was EASY. I mean really. Did we have to a practice quiz for the test on Friday. The test is on factoring and solving quadratic equations by factoring. &nbsp;Super easy. &nbsp;Also, Mr. Bredder promised that all of the questions would be straightforward and simple: not frustrating and fun. &nbsp;Oh well, next semester I get to take trig and then in the fall I get to take&nbsp;Calculus. &nbsp;I can't wait! I've never really ever been challenged much in math.<br /><br />Next class, PEGlish was kinda fun. We went over the theses that everyone had submitted for our papers. It was quite amusing at times. At one point a stink bug was flying around the classroom, and then we had an impromptu grammar lesson on apostrophes and the Oxford comma (the comma before the "and" in a list). &nbsp;Dr. Kennedy is very much for the comma. &nbsp;I must remember to put it in my lists. &nbsp;Also, we had a long discussion on the usefulness of standardized testing. &nbsp;All of us were against it, so we just shared stories. &nbsp;I talked about the TCAPS (bane of my educational career) and the CRTs and the NeSA (both not too bad). &nbsp;I think that standardized testing can be useful, but most of the time it just makes teachers teach to the test which is no fun.<br /><br />Personal finance was fun. We discussed credit reports today, and we talked a lot. Most of that class is discussion, but Professor Ewing some how still manages to cram and homework into each one. &nbsp;Last weekend I spent <i>all </i>of Sunday working on homework for that class. &nbsp;It wasn't supposed to take all day, but luckily I'd already finished the rest of my Monday homework. Oh and o m i g o d they had moose tracks in the ice cream thing at Hunt for lunch: moose tracks. &nbsp;Usually they just have chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. &nbsp;Today, they didn't even have those. They had lemon sorbet, mint chocolate chip, cookies and creme, and moose tracks!!!! It was so yummy which was good because the real food was d i s g u s t i n g. &nbsp;I waited for like ten minutes for beef ravioli and guess what? It was bow ties with beef sauce not ravioli. It was actually better than dinner, but hey. I wanted ravioli.<br /><br />Class five, marching band!!!!! I love marching band. It is so much fun!!! We have really fun music an we march around. &nbsp;Ooh and we got to see the design for the t-shirt today and it is awesome!! &nbsp;Also, also...wait for it...we have a free trip to New York next semester to play in the Saint Patrick's Day parade. Yes I did say "free." I can't wait!!!!<br /><br />Also guys you should check out Madi's blog (collegewithchester.blogspot.com). &nbsp;I'm on there some too, but just in spirit I don't actually post.<br /><br />I'll see you on the morrow. Good night guys.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora Wogsland<br /><br />P.S. I don't have class tomorrow!!!! MBC 101 was canceled!!! I'm&nbsp;ecstatic!!!
