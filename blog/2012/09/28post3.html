Dear parents,<br />I am an official geek now. I have Minecraft and today I started my first game of Dungeons and Dragons. It was so much fun!!! I have never played D&amp;D before, so tonight I made my first character ever. Her name is Amanda and she is a human ranger: basically a girl version of Aragorn without the whole royal blood line thing. &nbsp;She has studded leather armor and a long bow. On Sunday we are meeting to play our first module and I am super excited. I must remember before then though to finish all of my homework.<br /><br />More exciting news, season six of <i>The Guild&nbsp;</i>premieres&nbsp;on Tuesday and I can't wait. &nbsp;A whole bunch of nerdy stuff has been happening lately and it's just so awesome. &nbsp;Now I'm going to go watch the first two episodes of the new show <i>Revolution </i>on Hulu because the next episode of <i>Grimm</i>&nbsp;isn't up yet. Hmph. It should be up tomorrow though.<br /><br />I just glanced back at this post and realized what a major geeky nerd of a person I am, but hey, it's fun to be a nerd.<br /><br />See you in Nerdfighteria,<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora<br /><br />P.S. I'm sorry Hank Green if I spelled Nerdfighteria wrong.
