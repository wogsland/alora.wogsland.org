Dear Parents,<br /><div>Yesterday was pretty awesome. I worked most of the morning, but it was really getting paid to do homework. &nbsp;My supervisor didn't have much for me to do. &nbsp;However, I did send mail and use the copy machine yesterday. I also played Minecraft...a lot. &nbsp;I played for most of the day. I did still do homework. &nbsp;I just didn't have that much homework yesterday and now it's Friday. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday.</div><div><br /></div><div>Sorry, force of habit. Now, more about yesterday...I ate candy corn!!! &nbsp;I love candy corn and my TA for Personal Finance brought it to lab yesterday. Then, guess what? I ate it. hehehe. I love candy corn.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also only had work and the one class yesterday. Woot! Woot!&nbsp;</div><div>I will talk to you all tonight.</div><div><br /></div><div>Love,</div><div>Alora</div>
