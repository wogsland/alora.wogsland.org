		Hey guess what, guys?<br />I'm in a whole bunch of pain right now. For those of you that don't know I have thick curly hair and tonight my friends decided to straighten it. &nbsp;So Mimi and Madi got their straighteners out an went to work. &nbsp;Well, you know how it is with friends everything goes everywhere so, they were taking a break from straightening my hair. &nbsp;Lucky me, I leaned back to put my elbows on the ground and what did I find. A burning hot, water sizzling, super strength hair straightener. &nbsp;I said ouch and then sort of went into shocked mode and asked for some ice. &nbsp;Yeah, so now I'm sitting on my bed in the dark with ice and netflix ready to go. It's hard to type so I'm out.<br /><br />Alora signing off.
