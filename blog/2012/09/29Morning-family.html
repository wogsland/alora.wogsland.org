		Good Morning Family,<br />Yesterday was Friday, as you know, and today I slept in!!!! Yeah!! Although in reality I only got seven hours of sleep because I went to bed at 2:30. &nbsp;We watched <i>The Avengers, </i>but we started it at like 1:30 so it wasn't eve over yet when I went to bed. &nbsp;It was super fun to just watch part of it though because I was able to watch it with a large group of girls and we sat there commenting on the hot, sexiness of the guys. &nbsp;I mean who doesn't love Captain America and Thor and Iron Man all in the same freaking movie. &nbsp;Then when I got up I watched the next episode of <i>Grimm</i>&nbsp;and it was AWESOME!!!!! I won't spill any details in case you haven't seen it yet, but it rocked. Yeah!!! Well, I'm past the fun part of the weekend. Now it's time to do homework. yay...<br /><br />Talk to you later,<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
