		So apparently my little siblings don't have school today so I was skyping them earlier. &nbsp;We were having a jolly old chat. The first ten minutes they were watching Ninjago, and then we talked for a little while while they played games. &nbsp;I was tired so I laid my head down on my desk and I fell asleep. They didn't even notice. I was asleep until Madi came back from class and woke me up. They didn't even notice I was asleep they just kept on talking. Then when Madi came in they realized that I had been asleep. I had no idea what they had just said. &nbsp;It was insane because it was one of those times where you are so tired that you don't realize that you fell asleep until you wake up. &nbsp;That's how tired I am. I think I'm going to go to bed early tonight because I am exhausted. I have been doing homework all day which probably isn't helping, but I got about nine hours of sleep last night so I should be fine. Oh well, I'll just sleep in this weekend.<br /><br />I need to go study. &nbsp;Just a quick post for now. Bye,<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora<br /><br />P.S. I'm still really tired, but I don't have time to take a nap.
