		Hello all,<br />Here at Mary Baldwin College we have a few very special traditions and one of them is Apple Day. &nbsp;Well that is tomorrow, so today is Apple Eve. We are having&nbsp;dodge ball&nbsp;games tonight between the classes and then we have a dance and tons of other fun stuff including glow in the dark capture the flag. I'm very excited and for a very good reason too, but you don't even know the half of it. 'Cause guess what? We have no school tomorrow and I am so excited. I still have to get up early for a super secret project which I will tell you all about tomorrow, but for now I have homework to do and a fun night ahead of me.<br /><br />I have got to go.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora<br /><br />P.S. I'm doing something related to apples tomorrow. Hehehe! I can not wait!
