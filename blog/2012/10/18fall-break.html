		<h4>18th October, 2012</h4>
		<p>
		So today is the last day of classes before Fall Break and I am super excited. &nbsp;Fall break is this weekend: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. &nbsp;But get this, because labs are cancelled because we have Monday off, I don't have class until Wednesday because the only class I have on Tuesday is my chem lab. &nbsp;Lab cancelling FTW. &nbsp;I'm kind of sad too though because most people are going home for Fall break, but I am not. At least my roommate is staying too so I won't be alone, but I'm pretty sure that the rest of the second floor is leaving so it will be just us. Hopefully I will get a lot done during this period of me not having classes. I doubt it though. I am going to Kings Dominion on Saturday which will be fun, but it will probably also ruin my ability to study for the rest of the weekend. &nbsp;Oh Well.<br /><br />Happy Fall Break MBC,<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
