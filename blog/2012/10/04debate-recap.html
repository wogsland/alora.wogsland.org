		<h4>4th October, 2012</h4>
		<p>
		Last night I promised to make a video, but I haven't done that yet and I may not. However, I am writing my blog post. I did not watch the whole debate, but I watched enough to know that we are screwed if we elect either of those men. I mean really people listen to their words and realize that they don't make sense or they really don't know what they are talking about. &nbsp;During the debate, one of them would say something that we should do, like cut spending. However Romey's plan to cut spending is to shut down PBS. I don't know about you guys, but I kind of like PBS.<br /><br />Twitter is now in an uproar over the debate. Last night during the debate there was a new tweet every 30 seconds or so and most of them were about the debate. &nbsp;It was funny to look at people calling out the mistakes and then others completely ignoring them.<br /><br />That debate was pretty similar to past presidential debates that I have watched. &nbsp;The two candidates ran in circles saying, "I'm the best. I'm the best. You're the worst. You're the worst." &nbsp;They were like kindergartners fighting over a toy.<br /><br />Please listen to your candidates guys. Pay attention to their faults and their promises. &nbsp;In the future try to get some background on your candidates before you vote two not so great people into the candidacy and then one of them into the presidency.<br /><br />Thanks guys,<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
