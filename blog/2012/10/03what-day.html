		It has felt like Tuesday all freaking day. I mean I know that its Wednesday, but I've only had two days of classes so it feels like it should be Tuesday. I keep half forgetting what classes I have next. Oh well tomorrow is Thursday and then it Friday and then I get to see my family!!!!! I can't wait!!!! I miss my family tons and tons. Also tomorrow I get to work in the PEG office and I think that I'll be putting up Halloween decorations.<br /><br />Halloween is my favorite holiday of all time because it is four days after my birthday. I'm turning fifteen. I'll be able to&nbsp;legally&nbsp;drive with an adult in the car once I get my permit which probably won't be until Christmas. &nbsp;That is the next time that I am going home. I do miss my house some, but not as much as I just miss the chaos of six people and two dogs in one house. It is very quite here.<br /><br />I also have tons of homework. Yay!!!!!!!!!!!! Not really, but tomorrow is my do homework day because I only have one class. That is a major yay!!!!!!!!! I have to go. I really need to pee and I'm hungry. So bathroom and then dinner my friends.<br /><br />Bye. *hand wave*<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
