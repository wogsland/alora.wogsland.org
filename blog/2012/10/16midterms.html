		<p>
		I am officially half way through my first semester of college and right now I have A's (I think) in all of my classes. &nbsp;None of my classes have official midterms, but they have all picked up the pace. &nbsp;I have some much homework that I shouldn't blog for the next month and a half. &nbsp;Paper due on Wendnesday, Personal Finance research also due on Wednesday, Chem lab is just a perpetual black cloud above me, and of course we have a full blown math test coming up soon. &nbsp;So it's time to study, study, study. I think I am doing pretty well, but honestly it is freaking hard to study. I swear it's not that studying is really boring (I mean it is) it's just so hard. &nbsp;I had no idea that studying was so hard. I understand what everyone has been complaining about all these years. &nbsp;I gotta go I'm headed off to bed, but I should get eight hours of sleep tonight which is a major plus.<div><br /></div><div>Good night my peoples,</div><div><br /></div><div>Love,</div><div>Alora</div>
