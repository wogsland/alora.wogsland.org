		<h4>5th December</h4>
		<p>
		I have been exhausted all day long. This morning I got up at 8 after to going to bed around midnight and then I fell asleep after getting dressed and showering. I was almost late for work-study because I slept until 9:30. I was still tired after that. I am just mentally and physically exhausted and it is only Tuesday of Hell Week. I mean what is going on here?<br /><br />Whatever. Today I did some fun stuff in the office. I made a birthday bag for our December birthday (not you Mom), and I wrote notes to prospective PEGs. I had so much fun. I got to write in fun colors to hopefully next year's freshmen. My hand cramped up after a while, but it saved me from cleaning out one of the PEG vans. Yay! I am working again on Thursday, but then I am off for the rest of the semester.<br /><br />Also, after work-study, I was still in the office and I helped Candice make&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/VAPFP">a twitter</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.virginiapawsforpits.com/">Virginia Paws for Pits</a>&nbsp;her non-profit pit bull rescue. She works all over Virginia helping pits find homes. On Friday she brought this adorable puppy in that was being adopted later that day. She had a broken jaw and was blind in one eye. Her veterinarian was adopting her. She was adorable. I spent a good 20 minutes petting her before one of my classes. Ok enough with the adorableness because I have no pictures to share it.<br /><br />Lab was fun. Not. We just worked on worksheets. Also, a photographer came for the newspaper and took pictures of me just writing on paper. Blurgh. It was the last lab too. I am going to miss my awesome lab instructor so much.<br /><br />Madi is apparently sick. I have been hanging out in the lounge all day (not because she's sick though. Just cause).<br /><br />I'm going to go to bed now. Go, follow Virginia Paws for Pits.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
