		<p>
		Okay so today is a Saturday, but I got up to an alarm and I have been working all day. This morning we watched the Hobbit! AWESOME!! It was super good and I want to go see it again. I cannot wait for the other parts to come out. After that me and the family, all six of us, went Christmas shopping...for each other. I got presents for 2/3's of my family and they are awesome. I won't say what I got them until after Christmas just in case, but know that their presents are awesome. Currently I am being rushed to order presents for the other third of my family before we play Settlers of Catan. I cannot wait to play it for the first time because Will Wheaton makes it look super fun in his&nbsp;<a href="http://tabletop.geekandsundry.com/episodes/tabletop-episode-2-settlers-of-catan/">TableTop</a>&nbsp;episode where they played it. So go play fun games and have very merry Christmas shopping.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
