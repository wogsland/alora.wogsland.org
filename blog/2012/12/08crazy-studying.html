		So I have been studying all day. It is soooo not fun, but I am taking a break for a little while to tell you about my day and what I have been up to on this lazy day of unlazy days. I call today such because I have been sitting on the couch all day (lazy) while working my but off (unlazy). Now Blogger spellcheck says that unlazy isn't a word, but I do not care. I have both of my portfolios mostly done, I have learned tons of new stuff for chemistry, but still not enough. I will most likely fail the final, but its okay because he curves it like 20 points because half the stuff we don't know.<br /><br />Yeah so that is pretty much my day, but I also went to a surprise birthday party. My friend Mariah's birthday is this week, I think, so her roommate threw her a party. Free food, balloons, and cake. It was fun and now I have chocolate.<br /><br />All in all my day has been pretty boring, but my High DM from D&amp;D has given all of us electronic versions of the first editions of the two D&amp;D magazines. I can't wait to read them.<br /><br />Also, the Wogsland family has created a blog. I am a Wogsland if you didn't know and my Dad has created a blog called&nbsp;<a href="http://wogsland.blogspot.com/">Adventures in Wogsland</a>&nbsp;which I think is pretty witty. So you can go check it out. I do believe the entire family has the ability to post including me. My posts will be shared on my twitter and I will sign my name too.<br /><br />I have to go write <i>another</i>&nbsp;blog post.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
