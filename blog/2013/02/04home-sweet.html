		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am home for spring break and loving it. So far I have hung out with my family while cleaning the house, watching movies, and just playing around. Yesterday, Jamie (Brittan's boyfriend) came over and hung out for a while. Before he did we cleaned the house up. While we were cleaning (by we I mean Mom, Maxwell, Zara, Me, Brittan and Dad) Dad realized that Brittan and I clean the house really well. His exact words were: "I had forgotten how much of a positive contribution [Brittan and I]. . .made around the house." I felt so loved when he said that. It made me happy inside. On another note we also went to McKay's yesterday. Jamie and I helped Brittan find the plays she needed for her theater class because she doesn't want to buy the textbook. I didn't get any books, but we found most of Brittan's plays.<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today I went to the orthodontist for a consultation. I have a cross bite and my top jaw is smaller than my bottom jaw. I have horrible teeth. Yay! Also they took pictures, like actual with a camera ones, of my teeth. It was super painful. They stuck mirror in my mouth and pulled &nbsp;my cheeks apart. Now I have a really small mouth so the mirrors didn't really fit: at all. It was super painful. In the end they used a small kid one. I need a small kid thing when they draw blood too. I have to ask for a baby needle because I have small veins. Also, they are really hard to see through my skin. At one point I was trying to get blood drawn and they stabbed each arm twice before finally finding a vein. It was not fun.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell me about a time you had fun being tortured by your doctors or maybe sometime you cleaned the house.</div><div><br /></div><div>Try to refrain from falling out of trees.</div><div><br /></div><div>Love,</div><div>Alora</div>
