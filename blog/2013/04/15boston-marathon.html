		<h4>15th, April</h4>
		<p>
		I was busy taking a glorious exam today when the explosions rocked Boston. News continues to come out, but from what I have heard on Twitter 12 are dead and over a hundred are injured. Three bombs went off, two by the finish line of the Boston Marathon and one by the JFK Library. A fourth bomb apparently was defused by the police.I have heard people are blaming muslims because they have not caught anyone yet. More information continues to come out, but we will probably not know the full story until tomorrow and more information will continue to be uncovered after that. Many of these stats will probably change, but this is how it is right now.<br /><br />Stay safe Boston.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
