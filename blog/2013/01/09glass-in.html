		<h4>9th January, 2013</h4>
		<p>
		Four years ago when my family and I were moving into our house in Lincoln, NE, which we have since moved out of, Mom fell and cut her hand. It was right after we had started moving in and she was walking up the driveway with one of those Starbucks drinks that you can buy in the store in the glass bottles. She fell and her hand landed on the bottle which cut her hand pretty badly. We went to the ER and she got all fixed up, but there was still glass in her hand that she found later. Since then she has hand pain while doing some things because of the glass. She went to the doctor for it before and they didn't get it out. They couldn't even find it, but today she got hand surgery and they finally found and removed the glass. Yay! Go Momma.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
