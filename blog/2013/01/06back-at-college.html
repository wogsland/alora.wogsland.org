		<h4>6th January, 2013</h4>
		<p>
		Well yesterday we drove up to MBC for the start of the 2013 spring semester. And yes for those of you sticklers, I did not just "ride" in the car I did actually drive it. Now I am back in Virginia and ready to rock and roll. However my roll is missing. Sadly my roommate decided to skip this semester and hopefully come back next semester. I am very sad because I had Christmas and birthday presents for her. Also I am now in a room by myself. I really hope that I do not become a hermit. I got my books with Brittan all the while missing Madi. I respect her decision to stay home, but we will all miss her here. Tomorrow my second semester starts. I have 19 semester hours and I know that I will rock my classes.<br /><br />I have to go check Blackboard now.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
