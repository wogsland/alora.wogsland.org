		<h4>4th January, 2013</h4>
		<p>
		Christmas Break:<br /><br />I got tons of cool Christmas presents. I got my learner's permit. I went to work with Dad. I hung out with my family. I played Settlers of Catan. I watched seasons 2-6 of Doctor Who. I went to the dentist with no cavities. I started Torchwood. I saw my grandparents. I got a camera. I had a pretty sweet Christmas break, and now I have to go back to school.<br /><br />Tomorrow we are driving back up to MBC with all of the stuff that I should be packing right now. I am going to miss home so much because the sentences above don't even begin to cover my break.<br /><br />I will give more detail later before classes start. I have stuff to do now.
