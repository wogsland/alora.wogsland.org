		I have just been writing a poem for poetry and after this I think I am going to work on one of the stories that I are sitting on the back burner. I really like writing and creating and math. I love math. There is always a right answer. I hate English. Everything is up for interpretation. I need to find a job where I can do fun math problems while writing and creating. I should write a website. I am so inspired right now. Just positively pumped for anything, but studying. I guess I will just get up early tomorrow and study. Brittan braided my hair today in pigtail braids and it looks adorable!! :) It was super fun to wear my hair like this today. I just need to focus my creativity on a project.<br /><br /><br />To the to-do list.........<br /><br /><br />Okay so I want to write a book at some point. I could do that.<br /><br />I also want to rebuild Wogsland.org. I could do <i>that.</i><br /><br />I have more homework. I could....yeah, no.<br /><br />Okay so it is decided. I am tired and don't really want to do tons of research and deal with code.<br /><br /><br />To the stories.....<br /><br /><br />Story one: Amanda, archery, sadness<br /><br />Story two: hawks, sci-fi, romance<br /><br />story three: make something new up<br /><br />It is decided! Story two wins!!!!!<br /><br />*&nbsp;raucous&nbsp;crowd applause*<br /><br />"In accepting this prize story two would you like to say something?"<br /><br />"Well...there is one thing that I would like to say to my lovely author."<br /><br />"And..."<br /><br />"WHY DID YOU ABANDON ME?"<br /><br />"Woah, that's some pretty strong emotions folks. Lets turn this over to the author then."<br /><br />"Um....school?"<br /><br />"I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. YOU LOVED ME. WHAT HAPPENED?"<br /><br />"I ran out of time. Okay? Writing you was hard work. I barely made it through the chapters that I did. Your story is complete: just not written out. I'm sorry. Look, to make it up to you I will spend an hour every day working on something not related to school. It will be my break hour. I may not be working on you, but I will try ok?"<br /><br />"Fine. Just please finish me someday."<br /><br />"Of course. I love you. I will flesh you out and polish you up someday."<br /><br />"Isn't that precious folks. Well onto the next person....."<br /><br />So that was a little, uh... different. I am not quite sure why I just started writing like that, but hey. I hope you had fun reading it. I totally wrote it while saying their voices in my head too. Like right now I am also saying this in my head as I type. It is super fun. How do you guys think? Sounds? Words? Pictures?<br /><br />Story two is calling.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
