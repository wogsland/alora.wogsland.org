		So I have a To-Do list on Google Docs and it has all of my homework on it. Keep in mind that I have 19 semester hours. There are currently 12 items in my homework list and some due until the end of the month. I love my life. I keep getting super ahead on my homework. I am not stressed about it at all. Super excited. I have an essay in Intro to Literature, and poems to revise and tons of other things to do, but I know that I can do them within reasonable amounts of time. I also know that it will be fun. I have one boring class this semester and it is only kind of boring. I am just taking it because it is required for graduation.
