		<br /><br />So last night I was feeling a little stressed so I sat down and made this.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aVJrXIJDlUA/UPmrQimoTcI/AAAAAAAAAJw/ygL3s65wQV4/s1600/DSCF0070.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aVJrXIJDlUA/UPmrQimoTcI/AAAAAAAAAJw/ygL3s65wQV4/s320/DSCF0070.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>Isn't it adorable!!!! I bought some cute fat quarters at Walmart a while back and so I decided to use my monster one to make a ID holder because my other one broke. Just so all of you know I may shortly blog abut this one joining my other one in broken land because I hand stitched it. It didn't take that long. Only about two or three hours. Although I didn't get much homework done last night. I did watch three more episodes of <i>Torchwood</i>&nbsp;though which was fun. I felt much better after making this and I get to show it to everyone today. Here are some pictures of the back and inside.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qby4XmY_8Kc/UPmrQ_uis9I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/X9x4glXTU3M/s1600/DSCF0072.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qby4XmY_8Kc/UPmrQ_uis9I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/X9x4glXTU3M/s320/DSCF0072.JPG" width="320" /></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r1rkJUYYk80/UPmrQhTlb6I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/mJStBNKER-U/s1600/DSCF0071.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r1rkJUYYk80/UPmrQhTlb6I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/mJStBNKER-U/s320/DSCF0071.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>As you can see, it fits my phone, ID, and keys. The three most important things in a college students life. All I did was cut out two squares that turned out to be different sizes, hence the flap and then sewed them together. I used up almost all of my small supply of green thread, but I love the finished product. I need to work on the ribbon knot because it keeps coming undone, but that's what happens when you don't bring buttons. This is bored college student for you. I hope that I can share more adorable creations with you.<br />I may need to get more thread first.<br /><br />Don't forget your buttons.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
