		I have gotten some stuff done this weekend, but not as much as I had hoped. Hopefully tomorrow I will get more done. I will also work more on the essay I have for English. I have also started a short story trying to convince people that not everyone who wants to share their grades with you is bragging and to not automatically assume that they are excited because they got a higher grade then you. They may yet be, but be glad if people are happy to beat you then they put you in some way above themselves, and they are happy to have beaten above themselves.<br /><br />That's all for now.<br /><br />Merfblurger and go read <i>Shades of Earth</i>&nbsp;by Beth Revis.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora<br /><br />PS I am going to read it now, but I must resist.
