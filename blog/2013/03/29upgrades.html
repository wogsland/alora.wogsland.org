		So I haven't blogged in a while because spring break happened and then hell week ensued like a month early. I have been quite busy, but today I want to talk to you all about upgrades. Everyone is constantly upgrading. Upgrade Chrome. Windows updates (bane of my computer productivity). Upgrade to a smart phone. The word upgrade means move up. I recently have "moved up" in the small universe of the Early College Office at Mary Baldwin College. My supervisor is taking about a month off and I get to sit in her chair, use her computer (like I am right now) and answer her phone! It is the best thing ever. I am so excited, but when I was reading The Oatmeal I was prompted to think about my content on here. I just have been blogging about myself lately and not ideas or funny stories. From now on Letters to the Parents will be less focused on me and my life and more on life in general and my ideas and things. If that makes any sense. I will still be updating my life and stuff, but I am going to provide more content that is more relate-able than just "I did this today..." So Letters to the Parents is upgrading, sort of. I have finals in a two weeks so there won't be much change for a little while, but after that I will be moving stuff around and having a new content party. Feel free to join in on the comments. Please share and check back often it really helps keep the blog alive.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
