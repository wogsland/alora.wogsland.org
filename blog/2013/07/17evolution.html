		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So my name is Alora and I have tons of nicknames, but the most common and enduring one is Lolo. I was named Lolo by my mom's bestfriend's son. Her name is Kara. His name is Spencer. One of her daughter's name is Laurel. The used to live near by an we would go visit them often. Now, when we went over there were four girls, Kiley and Laurel, and Brittan and I. Brittan and Kiley did not want to play with Laurel which I thought was mean, so most of the time I would end up playing with Laurel and Brittan and Kiley would be off playing somewhere else.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is where Spencer comes in. As a little brother, he really liked to tell on his older sisters. Laurel's nickname at the time was Lolo which, when he told on the two of us got transferred to me. I was not there when it happened, but apparently he ran to his mother and said something about "those Lolo's" (this is said in a teary three-ish year old voice. I do not know if this was after we moved away or when we were over at their house because the story has been told many times and I honestly don't remember.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite this the name stuck and I have been Lolo ever since. However, Lolo has been spun rather cleverly by some of my close friends.<br /><br /><ul><li>Brittan shortened Lolo to "Lo" about an year ago.</li><li>Lillian made it "cool" by rechristening me "BroLo."</li><li>Mom and Dad call me "Alorabora" (I did not make up my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/alorabora" target="_blank">YouTube username</a>).</li><li>When I was a baby I was "AloraFuss."</li><li>About half of the time, everyone I know will call me "Brittan" (still not sure on the origin of this one).</li><li>When he was very little Maxwell would tell on me with "AloraBrittan."</li><li>I think I was "Alolo" at one point too.</li><li>People just meeting me have called me "Laura." (I don't like that).</li><li>Every now and then someone calls me "Lolo."</li><li>If I am really lucky, some one will call me "Alora."</li></ul><br />I will answer to pretty much everything because I have such a diverse pool of nicknames.<br /><br />What are some nicknames that you have?<br />Do you have another nickname for me that I missed?<br />Tell me in the comments below or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/alorabora" target="_blank">tweet me.</a><br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Alora<br /><br />P.S. Its Tuesday, so I posted a new video. Check out <a href="http://youtu.be/XliGWVuIklc" target="_blank">here</a> or in the top bar.
