		<h4>31st July, 2013</h4>
		<p>
		I did it. I’m done. I just finished the very first draft of my very first novel. I wrote fifty thousand words in the month of July and completed Camp NaNoWriMo.<br /><br /><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/5ae93881be99ddc6cc7d9c4f4dda328e/tumblr_inline_mqq3eim0MD1qz4rgp.png" style="-webkit-box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.498039) 0px 1px 5px; border-bottom-left-radius: 4px; border-bottom-right-radius: 4px; border-top-left-radius: 4px; border-top-right-radius: 4px; border: 0px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.498039) 0px 1px 5px; height: auto; margin: 0px 0px 16px; max-width: 100%; vertical-align: middle;" /><br /><br />I have close my manuscript and I am not going to open it again until I go back to school in two weeks.<br />It is so weird to not have something to do. I don’t have a daily word count to reach. I have no looming goal. I am done. I finished my first draft with about 50,300 words and I am going to let it sit. However, when I pick it back up I am definitely going to add more before I finally start to edit.<br /><br />I still am not used to the insane lack of things to do in the evening. I can get on my tumblr and reblog whatever I want and not have to worry about not hitting my word count for the day. It is very freeing, but also scary. What will I do now?<br /><br />Thankfully, I am planning a web show in the near future that still has no script. I have things to do, but I have no major deadlines to reach. I should probably set them.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora<br /><br />P.S. I actually won last Sunday on the 28th, but stay tuned I have two NaNo-related videos coming tonight.
