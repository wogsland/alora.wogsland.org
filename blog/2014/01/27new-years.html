		<p>
		So, it's the new year, and I know it's been that way for a while now, but I just figured that I should put my new year's resolutions onto paper or blog.<br /><br />RESOLUTION ONE:<br />To write more, everyday to be exact. I am participating in a challenge called <a href="https://twitter.com/writechain" target="_blank">Write Chain</a>. You make a writing goal. Mine is to write or edit for thirty minutes. It has to be a goal that you can accomplish daily because everyday that you meet your goal you get a link in your chain. The for each consecutive day of writing your chain gets longer and longer, until you miss one day and have to start over again. My current record is nine days which I broke on Saturday, when I got caught up in Signature Ball and completely forgot to write. I started again yesterday and now I have a chain that is one whole link long. The challenge is twitter based, but it is super fun and you guys should try it out.<br /><br />RESOLUTION TWO:<br />Ummm.... I want to better myself as usual. Be healthier, be nicer, etc., but I don't really have any other concrete "official" resolutions. So that's that I guess.<br /><br />What resolutions did you make? Were they the same as last year's?<br /><br />Go get something productive done.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alora
