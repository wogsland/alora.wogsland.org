		<h4>2 May 2014</h4>
		<p>
		Today was a day that I spent coding. I updated the homepage of this website. I changed around my homepage and created this very blog system.
		I also taught <a href="http://wogsland.org/brittan/index.html">Brittan</a> how to use GitHub, so she could work on her homepage here. I slept past noon, got up, ate lunch, and then sat down to code.
		Britt, Mimi and I went up to dinner late because Brittan and I were so engrossed in our play that we didn't realize it was dinner time which is unusual because I am always extremely hungry. After dinner, I painted a watercolor painting of the sun for my journal entry for today.
		Then I watched <em>Ever After</em> with Drew Barrymore which I haven't watched in forever. I had forgotten how wonderful it was. Now I am back to coding, and blogging.<br>
		I also watched an enlightening video by the vlog brothers about internet neutrality.<br>

		Then I went on to sign lots of petitions and get involved on keeping the internet neutral. If you click to watch the video on Youtube, there are a lot of links in the description, but I will also include some easy ways to speak out here.
		Now I am by no means an expert on this, but from what I know of the situation, it is something that needs to be fixed. I believe that we should keep the internet a safe open space where everyone has access to everything. Because who knows? What if people start not only making us pay for faster internet, but also certain websites. Then companies driven by economic incentives could drive the information that we have access to on the web. I am not entirely sure if these "new rules" could enable that, but they certainly seem to pave the way for it.

		<a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/05/01/broadband-net-neutrality-and.html">This</a> is a Boing Boing article about it.<br>
		<a href="http://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50409/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=13907">This</a> is an easy way to email the chairman of the FCC a pre-written email.<br>
		<a href="http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_fcc_break/?source=twitter">And here</a> is another petition that you can sign.<br>
		This is a big issue, but I think that we can keep the internet an open space for everyone and anyone to get access to everything.<br>
		I should probably go to bed. Guild fair is tomorrow!!!
