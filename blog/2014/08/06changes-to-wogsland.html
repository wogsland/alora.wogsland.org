		Hola,</p><p>
		I have finally gotten the blog section of this little website up and running. Well, mostly up and running. I still haven't finished the indexes
		for each year. The 2014 one is kinda done because it has the least number of posts, but 2012 is nowhere near finished.</p><p>
		For the past week or so, I have been working in a development branch, so that I could get as much of this place finished before it was put on the site,
		but I really want to get these changes that I have made out there. There will be more changes in the future, but eventually Wogsland.org/Alora will be 
		fully functional and I will only make slight changes, mainly adding things and posting blogs. This eventuality is very far away though. I have big plans
		for this place. I look forward to putting them into action.</p><p>
		In other news, school in Williamson County starts on Friday. Tennessee is freaking weird, but this means that Brittan and I will be spending most of our
		days minus Maxwell and Zara because they will be at school. Brittan goes back to school about a week after them, I think. I'm not sure. I don't go back
		to school until September 1st though.</p><p>
		Earlier today, I was actually asleep, Mom and Maxwell and Zara put one of our goldfish in the lake behind our house. His name is Chunk and for the last couple months, at least,
		he has been a solitary fish. But for Zara's birthday, Mom promised her fish, so last week, I think, the two of them and Maxwell went to the store and picked out some fish.
		For a couple days we had five fish and two frogs. Then, the two littlest fish died from the stress of Chunk constantly chasing them around the tank,
		and we were down to three fish and two frogs. Chunk was put in the lake this morning because Mom noticed that one of the frogs had his back fins
		bitten off. Obviously, some of Chunk's repeated bites had caused some damage. Therefore, Chunk was banished to the lake.</p><p>
		I'm just frustrated they put him in the lake without me.</p><p>
		Anyways, I have other things to do then record my life on the internet.</p><p>
		Bai! :D
